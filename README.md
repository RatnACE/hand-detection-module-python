# Hand Detection README

This program detects and tracks hands in real-time using the computer vision library OpenCV and the MediaPipe Hands module. It provides functionalities to visualize and retrieve the positions of landmarks on the detected hands.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the program files to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have a webcam or camera connected to your computer.

3. Run the program using a Python interpreter.

   ```
   python handtrackingmodule.py
   ```

## Usage

1. When the program starts, it will access your webcam and display the live video feed.

2. The program will detect and track hands in the video feed using the MediaPipe Hands module.

3. If desired, the program will draw landmarks on the detected hands and display them in real-time.

4. The program will continuously update the frame with the detected hands and their landmarks.

5. The program will print the position of a specific landmark (index 4) in the console if detected.

6. The program will calculate and display the frames per second (FPS) of the video feed.

7. To exit the program, press the "Esc" key or close the video window.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have a webcam or camera connected to your computer and it is working properly.

- The program uses the MediaPipe Hands module to detect and track hands in real-time. Make sure you have the `mediapipe` library installed.

- The program uses OpenCV to access and process the video feed from your webcam. Make sure you have the `opencv-python` library installed.

- Adjustments can be made to the program to change the number of maximum hands detected, the complexity level, and the detection and tracking confidence thresholds.

- The program currently prints the position of the landmark with index 4. You can modify the code to print the positions of other landmarks or perform other actions based on the detected hand positions.
